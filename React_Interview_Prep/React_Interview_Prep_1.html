    <h1>React Interview Set 1</h1>

    <h2>1. What is Virtual DOM</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" >=> Virtual DOM  is the virtual representation of Real DOM for the memory allocation there is two Virtual DOM where 1st Virtual DOM is the exact copy of Real DOM and 2nd Virtual DOM is to capture the changes which occurs in UI and after that 2nd Virtual DOM compare the changes with 1nd Virtual DOM and by the diffing algorithm 1nd Virtual DOM is updated with the change and after that for the recoinciliation 1nd Virtual DOM is compared with the Real DOM to implement the changes in Real Dom    </p><br>

    <h2>2. What is SPA</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" >=> Single page application is the application which work on single page in which when you are clicking on any button or selecting option from navigation bar then your page does not reload it just only updates the page without reloading then that application is known as Single Page application.</p><br>

    <h2>3. What is difference between class and functional component</h2>
    <pre style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" >
        Functional Component:-

        1. There is no render method used in functional components.
        2. It does not have React lifecycle methods.
        3. Constructors are not used.
        4. A functional component is just a plain or dumb JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns to a React element
        
        Class Component:-
        1. It has React lifecycle methods 
        2. It must have a render() method.
        3. It is stateful components because they implement logic and state.
        4. Constructor are used as it needs to store state.

Both JS and JSX are interchangeable but JSX makes the code easier to understand for users. </p><br>
