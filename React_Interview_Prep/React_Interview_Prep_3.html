    <h1>React Interview Set 3</h1>

    <h2>1. Difference between Axios and fetch </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">=>Axios has url in request object. Fetch
        has no url in request object. Axios is a stand-alone third party package that can be easily installed. Fetch is
        built into most modern browsers; no installation is required as such. </p><br>

    <h2>2. What is UseState Hook ?(Implementation)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">=> useState is a Hook that allows you to
        have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a
        variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this
        value.

    <h2>3. What is useEffect Hook ?(Implementation)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">=>
        <li>The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. </li>
        <li>Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.</li>
        <li> useEffect accepts two arguments. useEffect(function, dependency )</li><br>

    <h2>4. What is UseReducer Hook ?(Implementation)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">=>
        <li> The useReducer Hook is the better alternative to the useState hook and is generally more preferred over the
            useState hook when you have complex state-building logic or when the next state value depends upon its
            previous value or when the components are needed to be optimized. </li>
        <li>The useReducer hook takes three arguments including reducer, initial state, and the function to load the
            initial state lazily.</li><br>

    <h2>5. What is UseMemo Hook ?(Implementation)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">=>The useMemo Hook can be used to keep
        expensive, resource intensive functions from needlessly running. In this example, we have an expensive function
        that runs on every render. When changing the count or adding a todo, you will notice a delay in execution.
