    <h1>React Interview Set 2</h1>

    <h2>1. What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">=>React is known as ReactJs, which is a
        JavaScript library to build single-page web applications. Besides, React Native is a React JS-based framework to
        design mobile apps. Moreover, with reusable components, you can develop native mobile applications.

        React is a JavaScript library of reusable components designed to create skeletons of the apps, whereas React
        Native is designed to build native mobile apps with reusable components. React is an open-source JS library for
        building the UIs for web applications; besides, React Native is used to build rich mobile UI from declarative
        components using only JavaScript. Both React and React Native are ruling the industry and are widely used for
        mobile and web applications. However, the difference between web apps vs websites will not affect your user.

        functional component without having a local state but remember there is a hook in react to add state behavior in
        functional component as well this component are pure in nature which does a very specific task whereas Stateful
        component can contains the state object and event handling function, user actions as well.
